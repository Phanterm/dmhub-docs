- Are you wanting to free up space on your computer because your hard drive is almost full? 

In this case DMHub does keep a cache of files. It's typically not very large though (maybe a few hundred megabytes) and if you keep using DMHub it will end up filling up again anyhow. So we don't recommend deleting it.

- Are you wanting to get more 'space' so you can add more things to your DMHub game?

We don't limit the amount of data in your game, because that is not very costly for us. What we do limit is the amount you can upload because that is what is costly for us. So we have a monthly limit on uploads. Once you have reached their monthly limit you can rely on our built in assets, or wait for the next month to begin. If you support us on Patreon, then you get an expanded upload limit.



yes, anything. It's not just modules
but by "anything" we mean "any media"
so images, videos, or audio files.
that don't come bundled with DMHub.
everything else is free.
