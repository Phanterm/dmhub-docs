## Player Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key        | Function          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|  `1`  | Make the selected character unsheath the weapons/items in loadout slot 1.|
|  `2`  | Make the selected character unsheath the weapons/items in loadout slot 2.|
|  `3`  | Make the selected character unsheath the weapons/items in loadout slot 3.|
|  `0`  | Make the selected character sheath held weapons/items.                   |
|  `<`,`>`  | Change the selected character's appearance. (*Note: This only works if you are using a character with multiple appearance variations set up in their character sheet.)*|
|`F5`| Refresh the game. This is very useful if you think there is an error and want to reload the game.|
|`Tab`| Move to the next token you can control. For the GM this cycles through non-player characters (and monsters) on the current map. For players this cycles through all characters they control on all maps.|
|`c`| Open the character sheet of the currently selected character.|
|`e`| Open the emote controls for the currently selected character.|
|`m`| Open the spells (**m**agic) sheet of the currently selected character.|
|`i`| Open the inventory screen of the currently selected character.|
|`f`| Flip the selected character.|
|`Home`| Center view on the selected character. For the GM it centers on the map if they don't have a character selected.|
|`Ctrl+z`| Undo the last command.|
|`Ctrl+y`| Redo the last command.|
|`Ctrl+m`| Toggle the measuring tool.|
|`Ctrl+f`| Find items in the action bar at the bottom of the screen.|

## GM Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key        | Function          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|  `space`  | Freeze the game. This makes it so players cannot move around the map, and is useful if you want them to pause and listen to you. :)|
|`Ctrl+r`| Request players to make rolls.|

## Map Editor Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key        | Function          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|  `Alt`  | Toggles erasing while held down when drawing buildings or terrain.|
|`Ctrl`| Toggles grid snapping while held down when drawing buildings.|
|`Shift`| Toggles on the "eye dropper" tool which lets you pick selected wall, floor, or terrain.|
|`Shift` *(Using Ellipse Tool)*| Forces the ellipse to be a circle.|
|`Shift` *(Using Shape Tool)*| Forces lines to draw at fixed angles.|
|`[`,`]` *(Using Brush Tool)*| Increase/Decrease current brush size.|
|`r` *(Object Mode)*| Slightly randomizes rotation, scale (size) of objects you are currently placing. If you have multiple objects selected in the palette, this function will randomize the active object that will be placed. *(For example, if you select six different rocks from the palette and press 'r' after placing one, this is very useful for placing a bunch of random rocks.)*|
|`Ctrl+[`,`Ctrl+]`*(Object Mode)*| Move the selected object to the top or bottom compared to other objects overlapping it.|
|`Alt`+`mousewheel` *(Object Mode)*| Move between selected objects in the object panel.|
|`Shift`+`mousewheel` *(Object Mode)*| Rotate active object.|
|`Ctrl`+`mousewheel` *(Object Mode)*| Scale active object.|
|`F6`| While held, stops animated objects from moving at their origin. This is useful for easily selecting animated objects.|
