# Overview

Certain fields within DMHub accept a Goblin Script. You can tell if a field is a Goblin Script field because it has a small goblin icon next to it.

Click on the goblin icon to find some information specific to that field.

A Goblin Script input may be given a very simple input. For instance, a simple number like the 1 for Target Count in the above picture. It is also common to have Dice Rolling in a Goblin Script, like the value for Damage. However, Goblin Scripts may also be more complex, calculating things like upcasting rules and other criteria.
