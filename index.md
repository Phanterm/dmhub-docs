# Overview

Welcome to the official documentation for [DMHub]! DMHub is a powerful virtual tabletop solution that allows anyone to create and share a wide variety of content. Our vision is to enable DMs and players to have the kind of tabletop RPG experience they want, with as few limitations as possible. 

Whether you're a new user just getting started, or an experienced dungeon master looking to take advantage of its advanced features, this documentation is designed to allow you to quickly search for and find the answers you need to get the most out of DMHub.

# How to Use

This documentation is split into three main sections: the User Manual, Goblin Script, and Lua.

## User Manual 
The Manual section contains everything you need to know about using DMHub's main features, including hotkeys, map editing, object creation, importing maps, and more.

There will also be a special section for Guides, which contain tutorials and instructions on how to do specific, common actions in DMHub.

## Goblin Script
The Goblin Script section is all about DMHub's simple formula system, designed to make creating actions, spells, and other interactions easy for DMs. Although it doesn't require programming knowledge, it's flexible enough that it requires a good amount of documentation and reference.

## Lua
The Lua section covers DMHub's custom Lua-based API, which powers everything from the interface to custom rule settings. You'll find information on the REST API here as well, which allows you to query a DMHub game for information.

# Contribute

Please note that this documentation is an ongoing collaboration between the developers and the community; we encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to do so! Documentation is an essential part of DMHub and its community. By contributing to it, you not only make things easier for yourself, but also open up opportunities for others to innovate and create something beyond your imagination. Just think about the kind of experiences DMs and players can have when there's a dragon's hoard of knowledge available to make it as good as it can be! 

If you're interested in being a part of this, join our [Discord] community and we'll guide you through the process of getting started.
